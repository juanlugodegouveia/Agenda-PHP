# PHP Agenda

Contacts directory, created with PHP, MySQL, AJAX, ES6, CSSGrid and Flexbox. As a Web developer it is very likely that they will request projects of this type ["CRUD"], where we can create, read, update and delete data in a database. It is based on a form with all the required and correctly validated fields, the visual part was made with [HTML 5] and [CSS 3], where we include [CSS Grid] and [flexbox]. In addition to the implementation of [AJAX] and [JavaScript] that allows us to make the Website more interactive.

A simple design with which they could be cooked for future projects, the intention is to give an idea of how they could do it and save time.
